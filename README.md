# Get Killed By Circles

this is a game i made in the span of about 6 hours to teach myself godot, particularly godot with c#, because i am more familiar with c# than GDscript

the commit names are not very good/descriptive/reasonably sized because i didnt initially plan to make this open source (i was just using godot as version control), but it is now open source. enjoy!
